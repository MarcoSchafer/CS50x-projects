# Problem Set 2: Caesar

This project implements a command-line program that encrypts plaintext using Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a user-provided key. The program accepts a single integer command-line argument as the key, validates it, and then applies the cipher to the user input while preserving case and non-alphabetic characters.

# Problem Set 5 : Inheritance

This project is a C program that simulates genetic inheritance of blood types across multiple generations. It builds a recursive family tree where each person inherits one allele from each parent, while the oldest generation receives randomly assigned alleles. The program prints a structured, indented family tree to the terminal and manages memory safely by freeing all dynamically allocated data.

## How to compile:

Use GCC to compile:
```bash
gcc -o inheritance inheritance.c -lm
```

How to Run:
```bash
./inheritance
```
